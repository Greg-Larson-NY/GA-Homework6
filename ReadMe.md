# General Assembly Homework 6 - CitiPix

  

Homework assignment #6 for General Assembly's Front End Web Development Boot Camp. The assignment was to 
-   Use JavaScript to change properties of the DOM based on user input.
-   Explore the use of conditional statements and sanitizing user input.
-   Bonus: Learn about switch statements.

JavaScript is powerful. With it, we’re able to take user interaction and information and use it to update the page without requiring a refresh.

This week, a new startup in your city, CitiPix, is looking to create a personalized picture app that allows users to store pictures they’ve taken around the world and quickly access them by typing in keywords or tags. The team has asked for your help to start building the front-end prototype.

Our goal is to create a background-switching search form. Your input field will take values from the form and match them in JS. When there is a match, the background image should change.

Think through how to accomplish this. There are more logic steps than you’d probably think. Pseudocode!

-   Write pseudocode before coding to demonstrate your understanding of interactive programming theory and focus on the logic without being distracted by syntax details.
    
-   Store user-submitted information in a variable to be used throughout an application (this will make things easier).
    
-   Clean the data you get from the page (think about .trim and .toLowerCase methods to make things easier, you can chain methods!)
